In order to optimize power, of course, we want to make sure that our two test groups look as similar as possible in terms of prior voting patterns.\nThus, the steps in this design will be:\n\nCollect relevant historical data.\nDefine variables on which we wish to balance.\nAllocate treatment assignment using new methods.\nSimulate the power of hypothesis tests under the proposed design.\nFake some outcome data and analyze it for average and heterogeneous treatment effects.\n\n\n\nImplementation of methods"
